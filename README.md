# LinuxTools

A set of tools and scripts I use often to setup new VPS/Boxes.

## Usage

        wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/asimzeeshan/LinuxTools/master/basics.sh

### Warning

 1. Some of the scripts are Debian-centric. Read the notes carefully before trying them out to avoid frustration
 2. These may be very unstable
 3. Some of the scripts are dumb, it'll overwrite previous configs during re-installation/re-execution
 4. Its created to suit MY needs hence some of the stuff may not appeal to you, which is fine. You can always fork and modify it to "fix" as you please

### Updates

 1. It now downloads [bench.sh](http://freevps.us/downloads/bench.sh) in the /root/ directory

This script is inspired by the original works of LEA, it also uses some core functions as outlined by him.
